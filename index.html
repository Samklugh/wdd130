        I am Samson, and I am currently learning web development 👌. Becoming a
        developer has been a long-standing dream of mine, something I have
        always admired but never had the opportunity to pursue fully until
        recently. For a long time, circumstances, responsibilities, and limited
        access to the right learning environment made it difficult for me to
        take that first real step into the world of technology. Despite this,
        the interest never faded. I remained curious about how websites work,
        how applications are built, and how developers turn ideas into
        functional digital products that people use every day. My journey truly
        began when I joined the BYU degree programme. This opportunity marked a
        turning point in my life, as it gave me structured learning, clear
        direction, and the confidence that I could finally work towards my goal
        in a serious and consistent way. Through this programme, I am gaining
        foundational knowledge in web development, including HTML, CSS, and
        other core concepts that form the backbone of the web. Each lesson I
        complete strengthens my understanding and motivates me to keep pushing
        forward, even when the learning curve feels challenging. Although I am
        still at the early stages of my journey, I am hopeful and determined. I
        understand that becoming a skilled developer takes time, practice, and
        persistence, and I am prepared to put in the effort required. Looking
        ahead, my goal is to become a competent and confident developer within
        the next two to three years. I want to build real-world projects, solve
        meaningful problems, and eventually create solutions that can positively
        impact others. This journey represents not just a career path for me,
        but personal growth, discipline, and the fulfilment of a dream I have
        carried for many years.
